this is an electric gokart i made from scratch. it is 1.2m long and 500mm wide. based on the ninebot gokart pro. it runs on 48v with a 1000w motor. cost is about 376 dollars. i built this because i like gokarting. the 3d model looks incomplete but that is because i could not find parts online.

---

the frame is made using 1 inch steel pipe. about 6 meters needed. i am using mild steel pipe with 2mm thickness. i will arc weld everything.

the rear axle uses a steel rod. i will weld the sprocket hub and brake disc hub to the rod. wheel flanges will also be welded. steering is based on this: https://www.diygokarts.com/kart-plans/steering-plan-assembly.html
