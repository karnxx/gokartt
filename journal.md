# JOURNAL

this journal tracks the build of a custom electric gokart. the goal is to make it using basic tools, low cost, and common parts. chassis is welded steel pipe. powered by 48v battery and 1000w motor. design is based on existing gokart layouts. more details in the guide and bom.

### day 1: 30 may, 2025 (2 hours)

- made the chassis using 1" mild steel pipe. smaw. the chassis is around 1m long and 600mm wide. pipe needed is around 6 meters (5805mm total).  
- design reference: [this chassis](https://grabcad.com/library/designing-a-go-kart-chassis-with-a-roll-hoop-for-safety-1)  
- rear axle is 1" diameter, 600mm long solid steel rod. sprocket, brake disc, wheel hubs will be welded directly. no bearings yet.  
- braking system will use hydraulic disc caliper. rear wheels will be fixed to axle.  
- kept the design simple to make welding and cutting easy.

### day 2: 31 may, 2025 (2 hours)

- main chassis work done.  
- steering setup planned using flatbar and m12 bolts. based on this layout: [steering system](https://www.diygokarts.com/kart-plans/steering-plan-assembly.html)  
- seat will be a plastic seat bolted to the frame (around 2500 inr).  
- power system: 48v 12ah lifepo4 battery + 1000w brushed dc motor. may switch to brushless later.  
- estimated runtime is 30 minutes per charge (around 25km).  
- wheels: 11 inch diameter, 6 inch wide solid rubber (not meant for gokarts, but using them anyway).  
- rear wheels will be welded to axle. front will be welded to steering links.  
- using a basic plastic steering wheel (~1500 inr).
